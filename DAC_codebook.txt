Data Collection:

Data was collected by the study acknowledged above.  However, using the readme file from the study:
the study measured movements of 30 participants using a smartphone as they performed the following
activities:


It measured acceleration, movements in the x, y and z axes.  Each measurement was conducted over a
specific period of time, with one time-period being 2.56 seconds.  128 readings were taken within 
each 2.56 second interval, and though the number of repetitions on these measuremments were about 54,
the actual number of reps did vary slightly from subject-to-subject.

The measurements provided by the smartphone including the following types of data:
tri-axial acceleration (x, y and z directions) which is a rate determination of how fast a person
     increased or decreased speed in each of the spatial coordinates
tri-axial angular velocity - basically how fast the body is changing position, say, turning left and up,
     or moving down and right
The authors determined means of these multiple different measurements, as well as standard deviations, 
and it was these that were used for the Getting and Cleaning Data exercise


Dataset 1:  DanicaConwayDataSet1.csv 

Summary:  This file contains the non-aggregated experimental measurements for all test subjects, both
during the training phase and the actual test phase of the experiment, including all activity types
and repetitions.

Number of activity types = 6
Number of participants = 30
Number of records recorded including training and test = 10299
Number of variables measured in each repetition (kept) = 86, not including test subject # or Activity Label
Average # of reps included for each activity type and participant = 57
# of files used to create data set = 8, including column name file and activity type file, training and 
      test x & y data, and test subject for training and test



Column 1 = ActivityType, character, one row represents one rep of one test subject doing one activity
     (activity type was determined from linking the numeric value given to an activity to its name,
      as provided in the activity labels file provided with the dataset.)
      1. Walking
      2. Walking Upstairs
      3. Walking Downstairs
      4. Sitting
      5. Standing
      6. Laying
Column 2 = the participant number

Note:

Units are:
velocity = m/s
Acceleration = m/s^2
Angular Velocity = angle/s^2

Dataset 2:  DanicaConwayMeanResults.csv

Summary:  This dataset is aggregated by activity type, then participant number.  The values in columns 3-88
are actually mean values of the repetitions that were included in the first dataset, so they end up being
means of means (of means, since the raw data is also meaned).


Number of activity types = 6
Number of participants = 30
Number of records recorded including training and test = 180
Number of variables measured in each repetition (kept) = 86, not including test subject # or Activity Label
# of reps included for each activity type and participant = 1
# of files used to create data set = 1, which is the first dataset

Columns represent the same as in dataset 1, except that each value under a column represents an average value
of that measurement for that activity and that client
